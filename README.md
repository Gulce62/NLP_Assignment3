This project examines bigram collocation identification in Fyodor Dostoyevskyâ€™s literary corpus. Using three statistical hypothesis tests (t-test, chi-square test, and likelihood ratio test) with different window sizes (1 and 3) the hypothesis testing scores are found for collocation candidates. The presence of collocations is found by comparing test scores to threshold values. The study provides valuable insights into computational linguistic analysis challenges, particularly in the context of literary texts.
